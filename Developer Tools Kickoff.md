XCode Enhancements!
-----

*General*

* Prioritizes code completion results!
* Refactor > Convert to Modern Syntax
* Search & Replace using regex or *simple pattern searches*, to insert a token that matches any pattern of characters (semi-colons, line breaks, etc)
* Don't have to forward-declare methods only used in the implementation/private methods
* **Callers Assitant Category** : Shows where the method you have selected is called from


*Editor Improvements*

* **Improved quick help** - just press ```option``` key when API method is selected 
* **Trailing whitespace removal!**
* **Replace in Selection** - hold option key to replace in selection instead of replace all
* **Symbolic Searches** - definitions, references of symbols throughout project
* **Caller/Callee Assistant Editor**
* **Selective Commit** - comparision view has new control to "Don't Commit" to allow for cherry-picking changes
* **Source Control Branching** - creates new branch and commit!


*Optimization*

* LLVM Compiler 4 - increased language support, C++, among others
* **Compiler/Static Analyzer** improvements via Build and Analyze
* New analyzer checks - GCD, Security, others.  Can enable/disable whatever checks make most sense (in Pojrect settngs))

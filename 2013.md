WWDC 2013
======

* Ignoring Snapshots: Ignore state restoration, but still able to configure state upon app launch.  (AKA, resetting user to Tonight view each time they launch the app, instead of going to say the venue detail view from last launch)

Dynamics
----

Concentrates on behaviors with fluid, responsive animations.

UIDynamicBehavior

* addChildBehavior
* removeChildBehavior
* @property childBehaviors
* action block
* Supported behaviors: Attachment, Collsion, Gravity, Push, Snap, DynamicItem

TextKit
----



New Multitasking APIs
----

* Background Fetch

    * Fetch data in the background while in multitasking
        1. Info.plist add: UIBackgroundModes 'fetch'
        2. Enable Fetching [app setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval:]
            - never, minimum, or custom value in seconds
        3. Launched into background "application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:"
        4. Call completion handler, to create snapshot, can view updates in app switcher

* Remote notification

    * Send push notification (live or silent), and pre-fetch data before the user launches the app
    * Silent Remote Push Notifications, to update data/content on your app before notifying the user/displaying the app

* Background Transfer Service

    1. Create a background NSURLSession (NSURLSessionConfiguration) and add download/upload tasks (NSURLSessionTask, NSURLRequest)
    2. Launched into background (application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:)
    3. Call completion handler to let system know it can sleep and app snapshot is taken
    
    - "Discretionary Transfers" help preserve energy and data (only over wifi!)
    - From the background, transfers are always discretionary; from foreground, transfers can optionally request discretion
    - Use in combo with region monitoring and significant location changes
    

Continuous Integration
-----

Bot
* Defines what to build, when to build it, how to build it, and setup notifications

OS X Server

Xcode Service
* Bonjour discovery
* Create/manage bots that build Mac/iOS projects
* Join your server to your development team.  Server can request its own signing identities, all team provisioning profiles, etc.
* Devices
    - Add/remove devices to/from your team
    - Run tests on multiple iOS devices
* Hosted Git Repositories or connect to remote Git repositories

* Create and edit bots in Xcode
* Beautiful reports for build and test history
* Can debug builds that fail during CI directly in Xcode
* View test results across multiple devices and over time
* Commit history and logs

On Commit bot
* Build, test, run static analysis for every source change, hourly, daily, etc.

Nightly bot
* Build your project at 3am

Create a bot per branch
* Continually test each branched workflow

HOW DO I GET IT?!

* OS X 10.9 Mavericks
* OS X Server preview
* Xcode 5 preview
* Join existing ADC teams if you are team agent/admin
* Bring your existing devices


UIKit Dynamics
-----

Composable, reusable, declarative, real-world inspired animation and interaction system.

**UIDynamicsBehavior:** Associated with view or set of views. Declarative.
* Describes "influences" on views
* Can be added/removed at any time

**Primitive Behaviors:**
* UIGravityBehavior
* UICollisionBehavior (Between a view and a boundary)
* etc...

SpriteKit
-----

Nearby Connectivity
-----

**Peer-to-Peer Wifi Networking:** iOS communication via wifi

**Browser UI**: provided by framework to discover devices nearby
* Invite other members nearby to join your "session".  Displays alert to peer to accept invitation

**The Implementation**

`MCPeerID`: identifies local peer
`MCSession`: defines a session (MCSession initWithPeer:)
`MCadvertiserAssistant`: (initWithServiceType:discoveryInfo:session:)

**The Browser** (aka BrowserViewController)

* Present nearby peers, send invites, handle invite responses, connect peer to session

Randoms
----

AirDrop - Drop receipts into the Awarnys application, accepting any/all documents dropped via AirDrop application.  Can queue work up to be sent through airdrop to your application.

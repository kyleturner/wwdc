WWDC 2013
======

* Ignoring Snapshots: Ignore state restoration, but still able to configure state upon app launch.  (AKA, resetting user to Tonight view each time they launch the app, instead of going to say the venue detail view from last launch)

Dynamics
----

Concentrates on behaviors with fluid, responsive animations.

UIDynamicBehavior

* addChildBehavior
* removeChildBehavior
* @property childBehaviors
* action block
* Supported behaviors: Attachment, Collsion, Gravity, Push, Snap, DynamicItem

TextKit
----



New Multitasking APIs
----

* Background Fetch

    * Fetch data in the background while in multitasking
        1. Info.plist add: UIBackgroundModes 'fetch'
        2. Enable Fetching [app setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval:]
            - never, minimum, or custom value in seconds
        3. Launched into background "application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:"
        4. Call completion handler, to create snapshot, can view updates in app switcher

**Remote notification**

    * Send push notification (live or silent), and pre-fetch data before the user launches the app
    * Silent Remote Push Notifications, to update data/content on your app before notifying the user/displaying the app

**Background Transfer Service**

    1. Create a background NSURLSession (NSURLSessionConfiguration) and add download/upload tasks (NSURLSessionTask, NSURLRequest)
    2. Launched into background (application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:)
    3. Call completion handler to let system know it can sleep and app snapshot is taken
    
* "Discretionary Transfers" help preserve energy and data (only over wifi!)
* From the background, transfers are always discretionary; from foreground, transfers can optionally request discretion
* Use in combo with region monitoring and significant location changes


Continuous Integration
-----

Bot
* Defines what to build, when to build it, how to build it, and setup notifications

OS X Server

Xcode Service
* Bonjour discovery
* Create/manage bots that build Mac/iOS projects
* Join your server to your development team.  Server can request its own signing identities, all team provisioning profiles, etc.
* Devices
    - Add/remove devices to/from your team
    - Run tests on multiple iOS devices
* Hosted Git Repositories or connect to remote Git repositories

* Create and edit bots in Xcode
* Beautiful reports for build and test history
* Can debug builds that fail during CI directly in Xcode
* View test results across multiple devices and over time
* Commit history and logs

*On Commit bot*
* Build, test, run static analysis for every source change, hourly, daily, etc.

*Nightly bot*
* Build your project at 3am

*Create a bot per branch*
* Continually test each branched workflow

HOW DO I GET IT?!

* OS X 10.9 Mavericks
* OS X Server preview
* Xcode 5 preview
* Join existing ADC teams if you are team agent/admin
* Bring your existing devices


UIKit Dynamics
-----

*Composable, reusable, declarative, real-world inspired animation and interaction system.*

**UIDynamicsBehavior:** Associated with view or set of views. Declarative.

* Describes "influences" on views
* Can be added/removed at any time

**Primitive Behaviors:**

* UIGravityBehavior
* UICollisionBehavior (Between a view and a boundary)
* etc...

SpriteKit
-----

Nearby Connectivity
-----

**Peer-to-Peer Wifi Networking:** iOS communication via wifi

**Browser UI**: provided by framework to discover devices nearby
* Invite other members nearby to join your "session".  Displays alert to peer to accept invitation

**The Advertiser**

`MCPeerID`: identifies local peer
`MCSession`: defines a session `[MCSession initWithPeer:]`
`MCadvertiserAssistant`: `initWithServiceType:discoveryInfo:session:`

**The Browser**

* Present nearby peers, send invites, handle invite responses, connect peer to session
* `MCBrowserViewController`: `initWithServiceType:session:`, then set delegate to be notified on browser related events
* `MCBrowserViewControllerDelegate` for handling callbacks within the browser actions

**Session Phase**

* Sending data via: Messages, Streaming, Resources (HTTP, text, etc.)

**Messages**: Chunk of data with well-defined boundaries (where message starts/ends, receive entire message in one call)

*Modes*:
    
* Reliable mode (app critical data, framework will re-transmit failed transfers, in-order delivery)
* Unreliable mode (time sensitive data, no delivery or order gaurantees)

*Send Message*

    [session sendData:toPeers:withMode:error]
    
*Receive Messages*

    [session:didReceiveData:fromPeer:]
    
**Streaming APIs**

* Start a stream & receive a stream request

**Resources**

* Files, webURLs, etc.

*Send Resource*
    
    NSProgress *progress = [session sendResourceAtURL:withName:toPeer:completionHandler:]
    
Callback is called once resource is transferred to the receipient (or if failure occurs)

*Control/Query resource transfer*

    progress.fractionCompleted
    [progress cancel]
    
*Start receiving resource*

    session:didStartReceivingResourceWithName:fromPeer:withProgress:
    
*Finish receiving resource*

    session:didFinishReceivingResourceWithName:fromPeer:atURL:withError:
    
Called in both success and failure cases (error is populated)

**Pretty Cool**: If Kyle has bluetooth enabled, and Stephen has wifi enabled, and Mike has both bluetooth and wifi enabled, Kyle and Stephen can still communicate w/ each other through Mike's interfaces...damn they smart.

**Programatic Discovery**: Finding devices/sending invitations programatically, or build a custom UI for discovery!

**Programatic Advertising**

    advertisier = [MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser initWithPeer:discoveryInfo:serviceType:];
    advertisier.delegate = self;
    [advertiser startAdvertisingForPeers];
    
**Programatic Browsing**

    browser = [MCNearbyServiceBrowser initWithPeer:serviceType:];
    browser.delegate = self;
    [browser startBrowsingForPeers];

**Send/Receive Invitation**

Sending

    [browser invitePeer:toSession:withContext:timeout:]

Receiving
    
    [advertiser:didReceiveInvitationFromPeer:withContext:invitationHandler:]    
    

Randoms
----

**AirDrop** - Drop receipts into the Awarnys application, accepting any/all documents dropped via AirDrop application.  Can queue work up to be sent through airdrop to your application.
